    <h3>Definitive Sonic Games Guide</h3>
      <p>I started working on a guide that goes over how to best experience every Sonic the Hedgehog game. Its very much WIP and still being added to.</p>

    <h3>Minecraft Mods</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelbreaker-expansion-2-pxbr_core-2">Pixelbreaker Expansion 2</a> (2022-23) Was the last MCreator mod i worked on before i took a break from modded minecraft. <br />
      Its full of misc. features that enhance modded play.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelbraker-expansion">Pixelbreaker Expansion</a> (2019-21) was the first big mod i worked on. So naturally, it became really messy and i had to start from scratch.</p>
      <p>I also created 2 smaller mods that got integrated into the Expansion later on <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelblocks-coin-economy">Voxel's Coin Economy</a> (2021), which later turned into emerald shards, <br />
      and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/harder-cobblestone-pixelbraker">Harder Cobblestone</a> (2019), which was a feature in the old expansion, before deepslate was a thing. <br /></p>

    <h3>Trouble in Terrorist Town Mods</h3>
      <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3355632160">ttt_warehouse</a> (2024) is my first attempt at a completely original map. Its playable, but not finished yet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2990882265">ttt_City_Center_23</a> (2023) is my first attempt at modifying a hammer map. The changes are mostly functional, and not pretty.</p>
      <p>I rebalanced a few weapons for my private ttt server, namely nerfing the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2990850041">G36c</a>, buffing the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3336119131">Smart Pistol</a> and providing a working version of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2990845088">tec9</a>. <br /></p>

    <h3>Physical Games</h3>
      <p>Im also working on a game where the players take the roles of differently alligned advisors to a King. Every round, the players can expend influence <br />
      to get the most benefits from a vote. I'll link it once its in a slightly more polished state.</p>
