    <h1>Definitive Sonic Games Guide</h1>
    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>
    <h2>Before you start</h2>
      <p>I made this guide as an easy and convenient reference on my quest to play all the Sonic games (or at least most of them). Below you find a list of a bunch of sonic games and what I believe to be the definitive version to play them.
        This list wont be perfect. I might miss stuff, or new mods or game versions may be released. If you find an error, or a section that fails to mention an alternative way to play the game, please message me so I can edit this doc.</p>

    <h2>The legality of emulation</h2>
      <p>This is a really difficult topic to discuss, since there are no consistent court rulings to go off of.
        If you want a heavily summarized and cut down explanation:<br />
        -Downloading an Emulator is always fine. They don’t contain copyrighted material.<br />
        -Extracting the ROM of a game you physically own and emulating that shouldn’t get you into trouble. You own that game.<br />
        -Downloading ROM’s from the internet is a different story. I don’t recommend you do this, especially for games that are still actively sold. Usually, only the people distributing the ROM’s get into trouble, but if you expect SEGA employees to knock at your door tomorrow to search your PC for ROM’s, you should probably stay away from online downloads.</p>

    <h2>Sonic Adventure</h2>
      <p>Vanilla Sonic Adventures definitive release is its Dreamcast release. Every version after this one has only downgraded the game (In both objective and subjective ways).
        Instead of emulating the game, we’ll use its PC release as a basis, bring it as close to the Dreamcast version as possible, and add a few small quality of life mods.
        We’ll use the <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/PiKeyAr/sadx-mod-installer/-/wikis/home">SADX Mod Installer</a> for this, since it comes prepackaged with everything well need, and also turns the 2011 Steam release into the 2004 PC version. Most mods are made for the 2004 version.</p>
    <h3>Definitive Version:</h3>
      <p>Sonic Adventure DX (Steam / 2004 PC) + SADX Mod Installer</p>
    <h3>Alternatives:</h3>
      <p>-Sonic Adventure (Dreamcast)</p>
    <h3>Guide:</h3>
      <p>(If you use the non-Steam version as a basis, the installer might not work. I havent tested it yet. IF this should be the case, just download the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/X-Hax/SA-Mod-Manager/releases">Mod Manager</a> directly and <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/games/5892">search</a> for the mods you want to add.)</p>
      <p>The Installer comes prepackaged with the Mod Manager, and most of the mods we’ll need. Select Custom Mode, make sure all the useful options like auto updates are turned on, and select the mods you want.<br />
        Id recommend selecting almost all of them, but these are the ones i don’t personally use:<br />
        -Dreamcast Character Pack (Only contains the Dreamcast models. The Textures are part of another mod. Remove this if you like the lankier DX models better)<br />
        -Pause Hide (You don't need this. Its Part of another mod)<br />
        -Steam Achievements (Remove if you don't own the Steam version, otherwise leave it in)<br />
        -ADX Voices and Music (Remove if you own the Steam version. It already comes with the better audio)<br />
        -Super Sonic (in action Stages) (Remove if you don’t want super sonic as a post story unlock)<br />
        Everything else should be activated.<br />
        Tip: “SADX Style water” mods in the original water. Its just named weirdly.</p>
      <p>Now start the Mod Manager (Not the Game) and Launch the game via the manager. Have fun playing ;3</p>
