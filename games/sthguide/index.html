    <h1>Definitive Sonic Games Guide</h1>
    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>
    <h2>Before you start</h2>
      <p>I made this guide as an easy and convenient reference on my quest to play all the Sonic games (or at least most of them).<br />
        Below, you'll find a list of a bunch of sonic games and what I believe to be the definitive version to play them.
        This list wont be perfect. I might miss stuff, or new mods or game versions may be released.<br />
        If you find an error, or a section that fails to mention an alternative way to play the game, please message me on <a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/voxel123.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> so I can edit this page.</p>

    <h2>The legality of emulation</h2>
      <p>This is a really difficult topic to discuss, since there are no consistent court rulings to go off of.<br />
        If you want a heavily summarized and cut down explanation:<br />
        -Downloading an Emulator is always fine. They don’t contain copyrighted material.<br />
        -Extracting the ROM of a game you physically own and emulating that shouldn’t get you into trouble. You own that game.<br />
        -Downloading ROM’s from the internet is a different story. I don’t recommend you do this, especially for games that are still actively sold.<br />
        Usually, only the people distributing the ROM’s get into trouble, but if you expect SEGA employees to knock at your door tomorrow<br />
        to search your PC for ROM’s, you should probably stay away from online downloads.</p>

    <h1>3D Games</h2>
    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>
    <h2>Sonic Adventure</h2>
      <p>Vanilla Sonic Adventures definitive release is its Dreamcast release. Every version after this one has only downgraded the game<br />
        (In both objective and subjective ways). Instead of emulating the game, we'll use its PC release as a basis,<br />
        bring it as close to the Dreamcast version as possible, and add a few small quality of life mods.<br />
        We’ll use the <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/PiKeyAr/sadx-mod-installer/-/wikis/home">SADX Mod Installer</a> for this, since it comes prepackaged with everything well need,<br />
        and also turns the 2011 Steam release into the 2004 PC version. Most mods are made for the 2004 version.</p>
    <h3>Definitive Version:</h3>
      <p>-Sonic Adventure DX (Steam / 2004 PC) + SADX Mod Installer</p>
    <h3>Alternatives:</h3>
      <p>-Sonic Adventure (Dreamcast)</p>
    <h3>Guide:</h3>
      <p>(If you use the non-Steam version as a basis, the installer might not work. I havent tested it yet. IF this should be the case,<br />
        just download the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/X-Hax/SA-Mod-Manager/releases">Mod Manager</a> directly and <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/games/5892">search</a> for the mods you want to add.)</p>
      <p>The Installer comes prepackaged with the Mod Manager, and all of the mods we'll need. Select Custom Mode,<br />
        make sure all the useful options like auto updates are turned on, and select the mods you want.<br />
        Since we want to active most of them, i've just listed the ones you might NOT want to use:<br />
        -Dreamcast Character Pack (Only contains the Dreamcast models. The Textures are part of another mod.<br />
        Avoid this if you like the lankier DX models better, add it if you prefer the Dreamcast models)<br />
        -Pause Hide (You don't need this. Its Part of another mod)<br />
        -Steam Achievements (Remove if you don't own the Steam version, otherwise leave it in)<br />
        -ADX Voices and Music (Remove if you own the Steam version. It already comes with the better audio)<br />
        -Super Sonic (in action Stages) (Remove if you don’t want super sonic as a post story unlock)<br />
        Again, you can just activate everything else.<br />
        Tip: “SADX Style Water” mods in the original water. Its just named weirdly.</p>
      <p>Now start the Mod Manager (Not the Game) and Launch the game via the manager. Have fun playing ;3</p>
