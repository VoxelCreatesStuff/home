    <h1>Voxel</h1>
    <h2>Hi! I'm Voxel. This website is an archive of the small projects ive done over the years.</h2>
      <p>WIP</p>
    <h3>Minecraft Mods</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelbreaker-expansion-2-pxbr_core-2">Pixelbreaker Expansion 2</a> Was the last MCreator mod i worked on in 2022 before i took a break from modded minecraft. <br />
        Its full of misc. features that enhance modded play.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelbraker-expansion">Pixelbreaker Expansion</a> was the first big mod i worked on. So naturally, it became really messy and i had to start from scratch.</p>
      <p>I also created 2 smaller mods that got integrsted into the Expansion later on<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelblocks-coin-economy">Voxel's Coin Economy</a> in 2021, which later turned into emerald shards, and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/harder-cobblestone-pixelbraker">Harder Cobblestone</a> in 2019, <br />
        which was a feature in the old expansion, before deepslate was a thing.</p>
